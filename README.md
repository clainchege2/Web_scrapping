British Airways Customer Review Data Analysis Project
In this project, the goal was to analyze customer feedback data from Skytrax for British Airways (BA), focusing on reviews specifically about the airline itself. The aim was to uncover key insights from customer experiences, which would support BA’s decision-making processes and improve customer satisfaction.

Tasks Completed:
Web Scraping:

Scraped review data from Skytrax using Python to collect customer feedback related to British Airways.
Utilized web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests to gather as much review data as possible to enhance the quality of the analysis.
Stored the scraped data in a structured format (CSV) within a designated "data" folder for further processing.
Data Cleaning:

Cleaned the raw review data by removing unnecessary characters, handling missing values, and standardizing text.
Applied text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to prepare the text for analysis.
Ensured the dataset was formatted appropriately for further analysis, removing irrelevant information and retaining core review content.
Data Analysis:

Conducted Sentiment Analysis to categorize customer feedback into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments, providing a general overview of customer satisfaction levels.
Utilized Topic Modeling techniques (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify common themes in customer reviews, uncovering insights on service quality, comfort, staff behavior, and flight experience.
Created Wordclouds to visually represent the most frequent words in the reviews, highlighting key areas of focus for BA’s improvement.
Performed additional statistical analysis on review length, word frequency, and sentiment distribution.
Insights Presentation:

Summarized key insights in a single PowerPoint slide, including:
Visualizations of customer sentiment distribution.
Key themes uncovered from topic modeling.
Wordclouds showcasing the most discussed topics in reviews.
Provided concise explanations of the findings, focusing on actionable insights that can drive BA’s business decisions.
The findings were geared towards helping BA improve customer experiences, increase revenue, and optimize service delivery based on customer feedback.
The entire process, from scraping data to generating insights, was completed using Python. The final deliverable included a presentation summarizing the analysis and key recommendations.
